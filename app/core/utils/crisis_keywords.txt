suicide
kill myself
end my life
take my own life
want to die
don't want to live
no reason to live
better off dead
can't go on
self-harm
self harm
cut myself
hurt myself
harming myself
harmful to myself
harm myself
planning to kill
planning suicide
suicidal
ending it all
end it all
not worth living
life isn't worth
pills overdose
hanging myself
shoot myself
jump off
jump from
take all my pills
take too many pills
going to end
plan to die
going to kill
in so much pain
can't take this
unbearable pain
drowning in despair
wish I was dead
wish I were dead
never wake up
final goodbye
last note
farewell letter
goodbye forever
this is the end
nothing to live for
pointless existence
exhausted of living
tired of living
tired of life
